This GitBook will hold all our information on the API of the Kirby TV Channel. As development and reverse engineering progresses, we will continue to correct information.

The Kirby TV Channel was a limited run channel where owners of PAL Wii's could watch free episodes of the Kirby Right Back at Ya! series.
