# XML Node Types

There are multiple types of nodes, each serve their own purpose across the channel. We will update the docs when we learn new node types, but below are the ones we do know

```markup
<settings> <!-- Mainly debug menu settings -->
<locale> <!-- Contain the text in the channel -->
<episode_data> <!-- Contains the episode number, title and synopsis -->
<help_data> <!-- Settings screen data -->
<promo_data> <!-- Data for the promo section of the channel -->
```
